The Missouri House voted Tuesday to approve a new congressional map that seeks to eliminate a Democratic-controlled US House seat, as Republicans around the country scramble to boost their chances of retaining control of Congress after next year’s midterm elections.

The 90-65 vote puts Missouri a step closer to passing a new map that would help Republicans control seven out of eight US House seats in the state. A vote in the Missouri Senate is expected by week’s end.

Missouri is the third state to press ahead with redistricting in recent weeks. President Donald Trump and his allies are hunting for opportunities to add more Republican-friendly districts in several states where the GOP has full control of state governments. They include Ohio — where a state law already requires legislators to draw new maps this year — as well as Florida, Indiana and South Carolina.

“This is one of the ugliest moments I’ve seen and felt in my lifetime,” said US Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, whose Kansas City-area district is targeted by the proposed map.

Cleaver has pledged to fight the new lines in court. The map’s critics also are considering using another tool: deploying a provision of Missouri law that allows citizens to weigh in on legislation through a statewide referendum.

The president’s party typically loses ground in midterm elections, and Democrats need to net just three seats in the House to flip the chamber. If they succeed, Trump could see a Democrat-led House thwart his legislative agenda in the final two years of his term and launch new investigations of him and his administration’s policies. </h3>
