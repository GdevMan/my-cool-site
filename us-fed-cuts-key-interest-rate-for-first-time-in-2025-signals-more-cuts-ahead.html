      <h1>US Fed cuts key interest rate for first time in 2025, signals more cuts ahead</h1>
      <small>September 17, 2025</small>
      <p>The United States Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by **25 basis points** — its first cut since December 2024. The decision reflects growing concerns about a weakening labor market and slower economic growth. The new target range for the federal funds rate is now **4.00% to 4.25%**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</p>

      <p>Alongside the rate cut, the Fed released updated economic projections indicating that two more rate cuts are likely before the end of 2025. However, officials stressed that further easing will be data-dependent, given inflation remains moderately above the Fed’s 2% target. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</p>

      <p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that while inflation remains an issue, recent labor market indicators have shown signs of softening. Unemployment has edged up slightly, and job growth has slowed. These trends have added weight to arguments in favor of lowering borrowing costs. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</p>

      <p>Some Fed officials, including newest member Stephen Miran, dissented in favor of a larger half-point cut, but the majority opted for the more conservative 25 basis point move. The split highlights ongoing debate within the committee over how aggressively to respond to current economic pressures. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</p>

      <p>Markets responded with optimism: rate-sensitive sectors saw gains, and borrowing costs edged lower. Still, investors remain cautious, watching closely the incoming data on employment, inflation, and consumer spending to see whether the Fed will follow through with its forecasted cuts. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</p>
