        Each player starts with 16 pieces:<br>

        1 King<br>
        <br>
        1 Queen<br>
        <br>
        2 Rooks<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        2 Bishops<br>

        <h2>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h2>
        <h3>
            How Each Piece Moves:<br>
            <br>
            Pawn (P): Moves 1 square forward. On its first move, can move 2 squares. Captures diagonally.<br>
            <br>
            Rook (R): Moves in straight lines: up, down, left, or right.<br>
            <br>
            Knight (N): Moves in an L-shape: 2 squares in one direction, then 1 square perpendicular. Jumps over pieces.<br>
            <br>
            Bishop (B): Moves diagonally.<br>
            <br>
            Queen (Q): Moves any number of squares in any direction (rook + bishop).<br>
            <br>
            King (K): Moves 1 square in any direction.

            Special Moves:<br>
            <br>
            Castling:<br>
            <br>
            King moves 2 squares toward a rook; the rook jumps over the king.<br>
            <br>
            Conditions:<br>
            <br>
            No pieces between king and rook.<br>
            <br>
            King and rook haven’t moved.<br>
            <br>
            King is not in check and doesn't move through or into check.<br>
            <br>
            En Passant:<br>
            <br>
            If a pawn moves 2 squares forward and lands beside your pawn, you can capture it as if it had moved 1 square.<br>
            <br>
            Promotion:<br>
            <br>
            When a pawn reaches the other side (8th rank), it must be promoted (usually to a queen).<br>

        <h3>What is Check and Checkmate?<br>
            <br>
        Check: Your king is under attack.<br>
            <br>
        Checkmate: Your king is in check and there’s no legal way to escape.<br>
            <br>
        If your king is in check, you must get out of check on your turn.</h3>
        <h3>
            Game Ends When:<br>
            <br>
        Checkmate happens.<br>
            <br>
        Stalemate: Player has no legal moves but is not in check → draw.<br>
            <br>
        Draw: Can happen by agreement, repetition, 50-move rule, etc.<br>

            Basic Tips:<br>
            <br>
            Control the center of the board.<br>
            <br>
            Develop your pieces (don’t just move pawns).<br>
            <br>
            Don’t bring your queen out too early.<br>
            <br>
            Keep your king safe — castle early!<br>
