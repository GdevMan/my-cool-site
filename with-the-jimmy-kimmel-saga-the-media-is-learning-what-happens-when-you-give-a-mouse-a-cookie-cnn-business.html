      New York  — 

      Late last year, ABC News spent $16 million to settle a defamation lawsuit with President Trump. At the time, you could squint and see the business sense of it: Just pay up, say you’re sorry and this will all blow over.

      It’s not blowing over. And it won’t.

      Across Corporate America, companies are learning the hard way that giving Trump what he wants won’t appease him — it will only stoke his appetite. (It seems some folks have forgotten the sage wisdom underpinning Laura Joffe Numeroff’s 1985 classic “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie.” Spoiler alert: The mouse has some more demands.) </p>

              <p> ICYMI: ABC in December agreed to donate $15 million to Trump’s presidential library and pay $1 million in legal fees to the law firm of Trump’s attorney. It also published an editor’s note expressing regret for an on-air misstatement by George Stephanopoulos. The case had centered on the anchor’s imprecise wording around the 2023 verdict that found Trump liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s. (Under New York law, Trump was not found liable for “rape,” as Stephanopoulos had characterized it.)

      Nine months after ABC conceded that fight, the network decided to throw in the towel on a fight that hadn’t even begun.

      Just hours after the head of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, made vague threats to suspend ABC’s broadcast license over comments by Jimmy Kimmel during his show, the network pulled the plug on the comedian’s late-night show indefinitely.

      ABC is hardly alone. </p>
