      <h1>Trump’s ‘Apocalypse Now’ threats conceal seeds of political weakness </h1>
       <img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap25250624635963.jpg?c=original&q=w_1202,c_fill/f_avif" width="700">
      <p> President Donald Trump is vowing to wield apocalyptic power inside the United States, even as the adverse impact of some of his key policies is becoming clear.

His weekend share of a social media meme in which he threatened to wage war on Chicago, the next Democratic city up in his crime and immigration crackdown, was a classic Trumpian tactic. It depicted him as a strongman unafraid to impose force and incited liberal outrage to delight his base. It was also laced with menace and implied lawlessness that reflects his view of the presidency as a tool of personal power rather than a constitutionally limited national trust.

Still, beneath Trump’s hyperbole, there are signs that his second administration, eight months in, is entering a new phase. His frenetic pace and thunderclap tests of the Constitution have thus far had a disorienting impact. Courts struggled to keep up. Democrats flailed, mourning their election loss and trying to work out the basic business of learning to talk to Americans.

But on the economy, public health and foreign policy especially, Trump’s policies are having impacts that risk political blowback. Democratic opposition is stirring through governors like California’s Gavin Newsom and Illinois’ JB Pritzker, who are both looking for a fight to elevate their own political futures. The president had a terrible time in the courts last week, with policy priorities at least temporarily disrupted. A landmark Supreme Court decision is pending on Trump’s tariff policy that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” could be “terrible” if the government loses, since Trump would have to cut refund checks for half of tariff revenue.

The White House response to mounting challenges is to double down on more disruption and executive power grabs. It’s the only way Trump knows. Its new front against drugs cartels in the Caribbean underscores the point. US forces last week blew up a speedboat off Venezuela allegedly holding drug traffickers. Officials reacted to questions about the potential illegal use of force and destruction of due process with machismo. “We have the absolute and complete authority to conduct that,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, without bothering to explain why.

The administration’s claims the boat was run by the Tren de Aragua gang could be true. But presidents lack constitutional authority to wage war without informing Congress or the public. Vice President JD Vance upped the populist defiance by saying he didn’t “give a sh*t” on X after a Trump critic described the killings as a war crime. Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul responded that it was “despicable and thoughtless sentiment … to glorify killing someone without a trial.”

Pundits often warn that events such as those off Venezuela are “distractions” from other Trump vulnerabilities. But there comes a point when the distractions threaten the Constitution as much as the original escapades. And when is a distraction simply distracting from another distraction? </p>

      <h1>Challenging political months may lie ahead</h1> 
      <p> Putting aside inflammatory X posts and military bombast — Trump now wants Hegseth to be called “secretary of war” — there is growing evidence that the administration is headed into treacherous political waters.

Trump’s economy — the pre-Covid first-term version, which offered a brief window of voter security — helped win last year’s election. But the Trump economy 2.0, now fully exposed to his idiosyncratic theories on trade and government intervention, is floundering in uncertainty. Friday’s jobs report was dire, not just because only 22,000 positions were created in August. It showed negative jobs growth in June, unemployment at 4.3% at the highest level since 2021, and the impacts of Trump’s tariffs and immigration purges on hiring.

By most measures in the report, the Biden economy was stronger than the Trump one. The manufacturing sector has taken a particular hit, which feels somewhat ironic since the president’s trade wars are meant to revive a 1950s-style utopia of factories running full steam.

For those Americans who buy dinner in grocery stores and who will not be regulars at Trump’s new White House “Rose Garden Club,” his claims that prices are falling are absurd. If this disconnect deepens, the administration’s spin could have a similar impact to the false trope that inflation was transitory, which helped sink President Joe Biden’s hopes of reelection. </p>
