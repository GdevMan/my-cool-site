      <h1>Getting Gligor: How detectives used genetic genealogy to crack open a 23-year-old cold case</h1>
      <small>May 7, 2025</small>
      <h3>Detective Tara Augustin, a longtime member of the Montgomery County Department of Police in Maryland, always wanted to work on cold cases.</h3>
      <p>"Throughout my whole career, my goal was to get to the cold case unit," Augustin told ABC News' Stephanie Ramos for "20/20." "These are all major crimes.
         They're either homicides or r<s>a</s>pes and there are ones that haven't been able to be solved. And I like the challenge of trying to look at everything with fresh eyes."
      </p>
      <p>In 2022, Augustin got her chance when she was transferred from robberies to the cold case unit,
         joining forces with another veteran officer, Detective Alyson Dupouy.
      </p>
      <strong>Augustin and Dupouy's full investigation is revealed in a new "20/20" episode,
         "First Comes Love, Then Comes Murder," airing Friday, Sept. 12, at 9 p.m. ET on ABC and streaming the next day on Hulu.
      </strong>

         weekly series right on your 20/20 podcast feed on Mondays,
         hosted by "20/20" co-anchor Deborah Roberts.

        The pair were soon assigned to the 2001 murder of Leslie Preer,
         a 49-year-old mother and wife from the affluent Chevy Chase suburb of Washington, D.C.,
          who had been killed in her home. The murder, which rocked the quiet neighborhood and haunted those who loved Leslie,
           remained unsolved for over two decades.

        From the onset of the investigation, Augustin and Dupouy said they made a point of staying connected with Leslie's daughter, Lauren. She had an incredibly close relationship with her mother, whose death caused devastation and cast a cloud of suspicion over her late father, Carl "Sandy" Preer.
       <strong> He died in 2017.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Doing this job, I want to help people.
         When you're in the cold case unit,
          you get to reconnect with families who otherwise probably have [been] feeling like they've been forgotten by the police department,"
          Dupouy told "20/20."
      </p>
      <p>
        Augustin and Dupouy re-examined evidence from the original case file. 
        Leslie had been discovered deceased in her upstairs bathroom,
        with the autopsy listing her official cause of death as blunt force trauma.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the challenges of cold cases, Augustin explained, is not
         "tak[ing] the original viewpoints of the investigators that looked at it before ...
         you have to take a step back and say well let's just look at the facts."
