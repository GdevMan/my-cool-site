      <h1>Brazil's Bolsonaro sentenced to 27 years after landmark coup plot conviction</h1>
      <small>September 12, 2025</small>
      <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been sentenced to 27 years and 3 months in prison after being convicted of plotting a coup to stay in power following his defeat in the 2022 election. The landmark ruling by Brazil’s Supreme Court marks the first time a former president in the country has been convicted for attacking democratic institutions.</p>

      <p>A panel of five justices found Bolsonaro guilty of five charges, including taking part in an armed criminal organization, attempting to violently abolish democracy, organizing a coup, and damaging both government property and protected cultural assets. Four of the five justices voted to convict, while Justice Luiz Fux dissented, questioning the court’s jurisdiction and voting to acquit Bolsonaro on all counts.</p>

      <p>Justice Carmen Lucia called the case a pivotal moment in Brazilian history, citing Bolsonaro’s intent to erode democratic institutions. Bolsonaro, currently under house arrest, has vowed to appeal the decision, which his legal team labeled as “absurdly excessive.”</p>

      <p>The conviction sparked swift international reactions, particularly from the United States. Former U.S. President Donald Trump, a close ally of Bolsonaro, called the ruling a “terrible thing” and suggested that further sanctions against Brazil may follow. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio denounced the verdict as a “witch hunt,” prompting Brazil’s Foreign Ministry to condemn his comments as threats that disregard the evidence and judicial authority of the Brazilian state.</p>

      <p>Despite being barred from holding office until 2030, Bolsonaro has insisted he will run in the 2026 presidential election. The single dissenting vote in the Supreme Court may open a legal avenue for appeal, potentially pushing final resolution of the case closer to the election.</p>

      <p>Bolsonaro’s conviction follows a dramatic political journey, from his early days as a fringe congressman and army captain to leading a far-right coalition that tested the limits of Brazil’s democracy. His presidency was marked by controversial stances on the COVID-19 pandemic, deforestation in the Amazon, and repeated attacks on Brazil’s electoral system.</p>

      <p>The ruling is seen as a key moment in Brazil’s strategy to defend its democratic institutions from far-right threats. Spearheaded by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, the court has taken an aggressive stance against misinformation and anti-democratic actions, a move praised by the left and criticized by the right as politically motivated.</p>

      <p>Lula’s government, which defeated Bolsonaro in 2022, said the conviction reinforces the principle that no one is above the law. “This ensures that no one dares again to attack the rule of law or the will of the people,” said Gleisi Hoffmann, Lula’s Institutional Relations Minister.</p>
