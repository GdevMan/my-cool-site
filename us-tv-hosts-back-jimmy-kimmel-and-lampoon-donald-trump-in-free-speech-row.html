      <h1>US TV hosts back Kimmel as Trump threatens TV networks</h1>
      <small>September 19 2025 14:25</small><br>
      <p>America's late-night TV hosts have rallied behind fellow comedian Jimmy Kimmel after he was suspended by ABC in a row over comments he made about the killing of Charlie Kirk.

Stephen Colbert began his show by saying "we are all Jimmy Kimmel", and said the star's removal was a "blatant assault on freedom of speech".

Seth Meyers declared it was "a privilege and honour to call Jimmy Kimmel my friend", while Jon Stewart and Jimmy Fallon tackled the free speech issue by doing satirical sketches in which they were apparently forced to praise Donald Trump.

Their broadcasts came shortly after the US president said the main networks were overwhelmingly negative about him and could have their licences "taken away".

<p>The row started after Kimmel said in his monologue on Monday that the "Maga gang" were "desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them" and trying to "score political points from it".

He also likened Trump's reaction to the conservative political activist's death to "how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish".

Meyers, the host of NBC's Late Night, began his show on Thursday by saying Trump's administration was "pursuing a crackdown on free speech", before adding sarcastically: "And completely unrelated, I just want to say before we get started here that I've always admired and respected Mr Trump."</p>
