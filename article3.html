      <h1>MAGA World Silenced After Kirk Suspect’s Grandma Blows Up Narrative: ‘We’re All Trump Supporters’</h1>
      <small>September 12, 2025 4:58 pm</small><br>
      <small>The <a href="https://dailyboulder.com/maga-world-silenced-after-kirk-suspects-grandma-blows-up-narrative-were-all-trump-supporters/">source</a> of this article provided more info on when the article was published</small>
      <p>
      After the assassination of far-right activist Charlie Kirk, MAGA talking heads were ready with their narrative: this is the left’s fault.
       The rhetoric was swift, loud, and full of blame — even threatening civil war.
      </p>
      <p>But now, with the arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, that narrative is crumbling — and fast. The MAGA world is suddenly silent.</p>
      <p>Turns out, Robinson didn’t come from a radical left-wing background. He came from a pro-Trump family.</p>
      <p>His own grandmother, Debbie Robinson, came forward to make it painfully clear:
         “My son, his dad, is a Republican for Trump. Most of my family members are Republican. I don’t know any single one who’s a Democrat,”
          she told the Daily mail.
      </p>
      <p>Just like that, the MAGA blame game hit a wall.</p>
      <p>That single quote torched the talking points of a movement desperate to find a political enemy behind Kirk’s death.</p>
      <p>The revelation is inconvenient, to say the least. Charlie Kirk wasn’t just any conservative voice—he was a leading one, adored across right-wing media.
         His death, during a speaking event at Utah Valley University, was immediately labeled a political assassination by many on the right.
          But now it appears the alleged shooter didn’t come from “Antifa” or a fringe leftist group. He came from MAGA country.</p>
      <p>Robinson’s father, Matt, is the one who turned him in, according to Daily Mail.
         After Tyler allegedly confessed, Matt didn’t hesitate. That’s how authorities finally brought him in after days of speculation and finger-pointing.
