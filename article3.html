      <h1>3 of America’s most iconic sandwiches and where to eat them </h1>
      <p>

      Is there any food more intrinsic to America’s on-the-move lifestyle than the grab-and-go sandwich?

      The deep, diverse array of US sandwich options owes much of its greatness to the creativity and resourcefulness of immigrant communities.

      Cities and states from coast to coast claim their classics. New Orleans’ olive salad-studded muffaletta was invented by Italian immigrants who settled in the city’s Lower French Quarter. The Cuban sandwich as we know it today evolved in Florida and was shaped by immigrant communities from Cuba, Spain, Italy and Germany. And both Miami and Tampa take credit for it.

      Feeling hungry already? We’ve rounded up 12 more of the greatest American sandwiches worth traveling for — or, if you’re lucky, seeking out in your own backyard. What are your picks? Please share them in the comments below. </p>
      <h2 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> Italian beef, Chicago </h2>

      <p> Made famous well beyond Chicago thanks to “The Bear,” this spiced roast beef sandwich traces its origins to the early 1900s and the city’s Italian immigrants.

It’s essentially a hero roll filled with thinly sliced beef and topped with the pickled Italian relish mix called giardiniera. Sweet peppers and melted cheese can be piled on, too. Ciccio at Navy Pier is a popular spot for digging in.

The version featured on the FX/Hulu series “The Bear” was created by the show’s culinary producer, chef Courtney Storer, who was raised in Chicago alongside her brother and series creator Chris Storer.</p>
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Pimento cheese, Southern states</h2>
        <img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1137427628.jpg?c=original&q=w_860,c_fill/f_webp" width="650" height="500" loading="lazy">
        <p> A humble Southern staple, pimento cheese is sometimes referred to as the pâté of the South, although there’s evidence of early roots in New York City. But the Southern version that made it famous is a particular favorite in states like North Carolina and Georgia.

It’s a regular offering on the concessions menu at the men’s professional golf classic, the Masters Tournament, in Augusta, Georgia (where the sandwich still sells for $1.50). The traditional recipe is always served on white bread. Inside, a mash-up of ingredients turned into a thick spread include the classic artery-clogging mix of sharp cheddar, mayonnaise and diced pimento peppers (a derivative of Spanish pimientos). Cream cheese, grated onion and cayenne or hot sauce may also feature in some recipes. </p>
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Beef on weck, Buffalo, New York</h2>

        <p> Florida might be better known for the Cuban sandwich that both Miami and Tampa claim as their own. But go anywhere along the Sunshine State’s Gulf coast, and in the Florida Keys in particular, and you’ll see grouper sandwiches on the menu at seafood shacks and upscale waterfront restaurants alike.

The white, flaky fish is a sought-after catch in both the Atlantic and the Gulf that can be served grilled, fried or blackened. According to a Tampa Magazine article, the first restaurant ad for a grouper sandwich was in Panama City in 1974. For a classic version of the grouper sandwich served with tartar sauce and a pickle, Frenchy’s Original Cafe in Clearwater Beach does an original beer batter-fried version as well as one that’s a tasty Reuben twist. </p>
